# Game-dev Learning repository

This repo contains examples and small games from graphics and games open source APIs and Engines in C++.

## Compilation and running

Just run the shell scripts, or use the cmake for compiling and running the projects.

## Notes

The third-party libs (.h/.hpp and .so/.a/.dll) aren't uploaded along with the code for size purposes. They're included in the "lib" directory with the other project directories (bin, build, src, etc.) and should be installed individually in the cloner system. The shell or cmake scripts in all tutorials shows the full paths for the libs.

The assets used by all tutorials (*-Learning directories) aren't owned by the author of this repository and, if used from here, need to be referenced. References for the tutorials and the assets are given below.
